Getting Started
===============

We're so excited that you want to learn how to code! We'll be happy to teach you everything you want to know along the way, but there are a few tools you should install first to make it easier on everyone.

Every developer needs a good text editor. Which one is the best is a hotly-debated religious topic for every programmer, but your first editor is going to be Adobe's [Brackets](http://brackets.io). This one in particular is really programmer-friendly, and has a bunch of really cool tools that we'll use in the future.

The very next thing you should do is head over to [GitHub](https://github.com) and set up an account with them. GitHub is an awesome website that almost every programmer uses that allows developers to share their code with each other, contribute to other people's code, and also acts as a great place to store your code in the event of a catastrophic failure with your computer. It's basically a remote interface for [git](http://git-scm.com), the version control system, which we'll learn about later.

- [![GitHub Student Developer Pack](http://www.bloter.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Github_student_Developer_pack_01.jpg)](https://education.github.com/pack)

As you'll quickly discover, HHSCS &hearts;s GitHub. They're a thoroughly awesome company that does thoroughly awesome things. One of the things they do is provide a pack of lots of really expensive software to students for the price of $0. That's right, they'll give you thousands of dollars worth of professional software for free. You should go [sign up for a pack](https://education.github.com/pack). You'll need to follow the previous step and make a GitHub account first, though.

- [![Git](http://mattbanks.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Git-Logo.png)](http://git-scm.com)

Remember that Git thing I told you about earlier? You should install it on your computer, as you'll ideally be using it with all but the most trivial projects you create, and not even necessarily just coding projects. If you're a Windows user, you can install it from [Git's website](http://git-scm.com/download/win). If you're a Mac user, you can install it by installing [Xcode from the Mac App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) and installing the Command Line Tools when you run it for the first time.

- [![Try Git](http://luigdima.name/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Code-School-try-git.jpg)](https://try.github.io)

The last thing you should do before you dive into your first lines of code is to learn the basics of git, which you should've just installed. GitHub (who else?) has an amazing [interactive tutorial on their site](https://try.github.io) that you should totally take.

After you do all of these, you're ready to write your first lines of code!
