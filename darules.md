Hendersonville High School Computer Science Club Constitution & By-Laws

Intro
-----
The Computer Science Club of Hendersonville High School is designed to have a laid-back, open atmosphere where everyone feels safe to create, learn about, or get help with anything they want, without fear of any ridicule, condescending attitude, or general meanness directed towards them for any reason from any other member of the club. Clearly, a very strict set of rules would get in the way of that atmosphere existing. That being said, as Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn put it,

> I will tell you that a society without any
> objective legal scale is a terrible one indeed,
> but a society with no other scale but the legal one
> is not quite worthy of man either.

This document attempts to provide a set of statues to maintain, yet without compromising a safe and fun atmosphere for anyone who is interested.

Section I - Other Rules to Follow
---------------------------------
It may seem odd that a list document begins with the "Other" section, but stranger things have happened before.

Being an officially recognized club of Hendersonville High School, we must abide by all the rules of Hendersonville High School and any bodies that govern it. The list of especially pertinent documents are as follows:

- The "Commando Code of Conduct" in the [Hendersonville High School Student Handbook](http://hhs.sumnerschools.org/images/docs/2015_hhs_handbook_v3.pdf) (Pages 5 - 8)
- All the rules enacted by the [Student Handbook issued by the Sumner County Board of Education](http://sumnerschools.org/images/admin/StudentHandbook.pdf)

Section II - Membership
-----------------------
Later on in this document, specific privileges will be delegated to members, so it would be useful to define what it means to be a member now.

##### A Member: #####

- Attends at least one meeting
- Claims to be a member
- Has not been explicitly barred membership from the club leadership

This club is open to any individual that meets the above requirements. This club shall never discriminate on the grounds of age, gender, race, color, creed, national origin, sexual preference, financial stability, or mathematical/computational abilities, or anything, really, as long as they meet the above requirements.

##### Revocation: #####

As you probably guessed from the 3rd bullet point above, the leadership of the club can ban an individual or group from ever participating in the club. However, this should be considered an extremely drastic measure, used only when all other options for discipline are exhausted, and the offending individual or group continues to frequently commit a major offense against this set of by-laws. Furthermore, an individual or group may only be permanently banned from club participation by the Teacher Adviser or the President. An individual or group may be removed from any club activity by any lower club officer, but only if no higher officer is present to make that decision at the time.

A membership ban can be overturned at the discretion of the President or Teacher Adviser. A ban enacted by a previous President or Teacher Adviser can be overturned by a new President or Teacher Adviser. However, if a ban is enacted by a Teacher Adviser, it cannot be overturned by any member of the club's student leadership.

Section III - Purpose
---------------------

Perhaps it would be of interest to protect the posterity of this club to state now the club's original purpose. Thus, behold! Our mission statement:

> Through education, entertainment, and camaraderie, our
> mission is to inspire, foster, and spread an excitement for
> and a deep understanding of technology to allow one to
> better manipulate the world around them.

Section IV - Officers
---------------------
<!--TODO: Eventually define officer roles and their duties, as well as how they are appointed-->

In the initial year of this club, the club's founder, [Michael Hulet](http://github.com/raysarebest), shall act as President, making all executive decisions for the club. As the year marches on, it shall be determined what offices and committees are strictly necessary to maintain, and members to fill those offices or committees shall be appointed by the President, and this constitution will thereby be edited to list those positions.

##### Impeachment: #####
<!--TODO: There's a >0 chance that there will be online voting for this club in the near future. This section will have to be edited-->

Should it be decided that it would be beneficial to the club, any officer of the Hendersonville High School Computer Science Club may be impeached. However, like a revocation of club membership, this should be considered an extremely drastic measure that is used only as a last resort option after warning the offending officer several (at least 5) times about their wrongdoings. In order to impeach an officer, a 2/3 majority vote of the club members in attendance is required.

Grounds for impeachment of an officer include:

- Consistent failure to perform their duties as an officer
- Lack of interest in the club, as evidenced by repeated non-attendance of club meetings and events, with no provided or a trivial explanation, without presidential permission.
- Flagrant violation of any of the statues listed in this constitution, without penance

As the 2nd bullet point of the previous list explains, officers may be impeached for frequently missing club meetings and events, with a trivial explanation provided. Therefore, examples of trivial and non-trivial excuses should be defined here, as a metric to compare an actual excuse against, to determine of which type it is.

###### Non-Trivial Excuses: ######

- "I was sick."
- "I had an appointment I needed to attend."
- "There was a significant family event that I needed to attend/take care of."
- "Something bad would happen to me if I attend."
- "I have no money, and this is a paid event."
- "My mom said no."

###### Trivial Excuses: ######

- "I didn't really feel like attending."
- "I was hungry, so I went to grab a bite to eat, instead."
- "This cool new movie came out today, and I went to see it."

Section V - Meetings
--------------------
What is a club that never meets? Nonexistent, that's what.

The Hendersonville High School Computer Science club will meet at least once per week, barring any extraneous circumstances. Unless otherwise stated, regular meetings will occur from 3:10 PM CT to 4:30 PM CT in Mr. Caine's room (Room 224) each Wednesday while school is in session. If any additional meetings should be called, or if any different procedures to this schedule should be followed one-time, any members that are expected to attend, as well as any members that frequently attend meetings, must be notified at least 18 hours before the meeting occurs.

Occasionally, the Hendersonville High School Computer Science Club will hold a meeting or attend an event that costs money to attend, such as [CodeDay Nashville](https://codeday.org/nashville). Attending such meetings is not required for any members, though they are strongly recommended. If any member needs financial help to attend such a meeting, they may request help from the club, and the club will either grant or deny it based on the money left in the budget at the time.
