Intro
-----
The Computer Science Club of Hendersonville High School is designed to have a laid-back, open atmosphere where everyone feels safe to create, learn about, or get help with anything they want, without fear of any ridicule, condescending attitude, or general meanness directed towards them for any reason from any other member of the club. Clearly, a very strict set of rules would get in the way of that atmosphere existing. That being said, as Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn put it,

> I will tell you that a society without any
> objective legal scale is a terrible one indeed,
> but a society with no other scale but the legal one
> is not quite worthy of man either.

This document attempts to provide a set of statues to maintain without compromising a safe and fun atmosphere for anyone who is interested.
