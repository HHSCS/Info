Intro
-----
The Computer Science Club of Hendersonville High School is designed to have a laid-back, open atmosphere where everyone feels safe to create, learn about, or get help with anything they want, without fear of any ridicule, condescending attitude, or general meanness directed towards them for any reason from any other member of the club. Clearly, a very strict set of rules would get in the way of that atmosphere existing. That being said, as Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn put it,

> I will tell you that a society without any
> objective legal scale is a terrible one indeed,
> but a society with no other scale but the legal one
> is not quite worthy of man either.

This document attempts to provide a set of statues to maintain, yet without compromising, a safe and fun atmosphere for anyone who is interested.

Section I - Other Rules to Follow
---------------------------------
It may seem odd that a list document begins with the "Other" section, but stranger things have happened before.

Being an officially recognized club of Hendersonville High School, we must abide by all the rules of Hendersonville High School and any bodies that govern it. The list of especially pertinent documents are as follows:

- The "Commando Code of Conduct" in the [Hendersonville High School Student Handbook](http://hhs.sumnerschools.org/images/docs/2015_hhs_handbook_v3.pdf) (Pages 5 - 8)
- All the rules enacted by the [Student Handbook issued by the Sumner County Board of Education](http://sumnerschools.org/images/admin/StudentHandbook.pdf)

Section II - Membership
-----------------------
Later on in this document, specific privileges will be delegated to members, so it would be useful to define what it means to be a member now.

##### A Member: #####

- Attends at least one meeting
- Claims to be a member
- Has not been explicitly barred membership from the club leadership
