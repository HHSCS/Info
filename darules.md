Hendersonville High School Computer Science Club Constitution & By-Laws

Intro
-----
The Computer Science Club of Hendersonville High School is designed to have a laid-back, open atmosphere where everyone feels safe to create, learn about, or get help with anything they want, without fear of any ridicule, condescending attitude, or general meanness directed towards them for any reason from any other member of the club. Clearly, a very strict set of rules would get in the way of that atmosphere existing. That being said, as Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn put it,

> I will tell you that a society without any
> objective legal scale is a terrible one indeed,
> but a society with no other scale but the legal one
> is not quite worthy of man either.

This document attempts to provide a set of statues to maintain, yet without compromising a safe and fun atmosphere for anyone who is interested.

Section I - Other Rules to Follow
---------------------------------
It may seem odd that a list document begins with the "Other" section, but stranger things have happened before.

Being an officially recognized club of Hendersonville High School, we must abide by all the rules of Hendersonville High School and any bodies that govern it. The list of especially pertinent documents are as follows:

- The "Commando Code of Conduct" in the [Hendersonville High School Student Handbook](http://hhs.sumnerschools.org/images/docs/2015_hhs_handbook_v3.pdf) (Pages 5 - 8)
- All the rules enacted by the [Student Handbook issued by the Sumner County Board of Education](http://sumnerschools.org/images/admin/StudentHandbook.pdf)

Section II - Membership
-----------------------
Later on in this document, specific privileges will be delegated to members, so it would be useful to define what it means to be a member now.

##### A Member: #####

- Attends at least one meeting
- Claims to be a member
- Has not been explicitly barred membership from the club leadership

This club is open to any individual that meets the above requirements. This club shall never discriminate on the grounds of age, gender, race, color, creed, national origin, sexual preference, financial stability, or mathematical/computational abilities, or anything, really, as long as they meet the above requirements.

##### Revocation: #####

As you probably guessed from the 3rd bullet point above, the leadership of the club can ban an individual or group from ever participating in the club. However, this should be considered an extremely drastic measure, used only when all other options for discipline are exhausted, and the offending individual or group continues to frequently commit a major offense against this set of by-laws. Furthermore, an individual or group may only be permanently banned from club participation by the Teacher Adviser or the President. An individual or group may be removed from any club activity by any lower club officer, but only if no higher officer is present to make that decision at the time.

A membership ban can be overturned at the discretion of the President or Teacher Adviser. A ban enacted by a previous President or Teacher Adviser can be overturned by a new President or Teacher Adviser. However, if a ban is enacted by a Teacher Adviser, it cannot be overturned by any member of the club's student leadership.

Section III - Purpose
---------------------

Perhaps it would be of interest to protect the posterity of this club to state now the club's original purpose. Thus, behold! Our mission statement:

> Through education, entertainment, and camaraderie, our
> mission is to inspire, foster, and spread an excitement for
> and a deep understanding of technology to allow one to
> better manipulate the world around them.

Section V - Meetings
--------------------
What is a club that never meets? Nonexistent, that's what.

The Hendersonville High School Computer Science club will meet at least once per week, barring any extraneous circumstances. Unless otherwise stated, regular meetings will occur from 3:00 PM CT to 4:00 PM CT in Mr. Willyard's room (Room 226) each Wednesday while school is in session. 

Additionally, HHSCS will also meet once every two weeks during Commando Time when students are instructed to go to a Club instead of Advisory.

Code of Conduct
===============
The Code of Conduct for this club boils down to one simple concept: "Don't Be Mean", or better yet, "Be Nice". The following section will attempt to outline what that looks like.

Be respectful of everyone around you. If you think an impressionable 7-year-old girl would feel bad if you told it to her, don't say it to anyone else. If someone says you are doing something that is unwelcome/offensive or tells you to stop, ***stop doing it immediately***, and ***under no circumstances should you ever do it again***, unless the offended party was simply being sarcastic about being offended, by their own admission.

If you have any complaint against any member or officer of the club, let any of the club's leadership know, and it will be anonymously handled accordingly. Discipline will be handled on a case-by-case basis, and appropriate procedures will be determined by the club's leadership after hearing each side of whatever story happened.
