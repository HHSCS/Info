Welcome to the HHS Computer Science Club!
============================================================

Looking to learn how to program? Or maybe you're already an experienced developer, and you're just looking for a place to work with other programmers and share your work? You've come to the right place. Welcome to the club! We're excited to have you.

If you're new to the club, take a look at our [rules](darules.md), and be sure to always respect them. We're pretty laid back, so as long as you're not being intentionally mean to someone, it should be fun for everyone.

We regularly meet on Wednesdays in Mr. Caine's room (Room 224, on the Science Hallway) from the end of school until 4:30. Come hang out with us!

Before you come to a meeting, you should follow our [Getting Started Guide](gettingstarted.md) to install and get up and running with all of the necessary software you need to write other software

If you have any questions or have something to talk about, feel free to [email our club's President, Michael Hulet](mailto:bestraysfan@me.com). He'll be happy to answer anything you have to ask or listen to whatever you have to say.
